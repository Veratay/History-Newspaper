                            We have seen it in the past.
                            Slavery has forever been a heavily controversial topic, and it is one of the prime topics of legislative debate.
                            In the past, the importance of changing or not changing legislation on slavery has periodically risen and fallen.
                            Slavery is also one of the main contributors to the sepration between politics and economics of the north and south states.
                            Southern states favor slavery, and it is the driver of their economy, while northen states forbid slavery and rely mostly on industry to produce exports to drive their economy.
                            Every time that public opinion of either the north or south pushes for changes in legislature, the other fights it. This usually results in a middle ground being reached, and that has been a consistent trend. But is this time different?

                            <h3>New Territory Brings New Debates, And the role of elections in sectionalism</h3>
                            <div></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            You might recall that in 1844 Democrat James K. Polk was elected and added Texas into the union, which led to the start of the Mexican-American War. When the war began, Representative David Wilmot from Pennsylvania created the Wilmot Provision which banned slavery in new territory from the war.
                            Southern states wanted slavery, so Senator John C. Calhoun said that there should be no regulation on slavery in new territories. 
                            Neither of these proposals made it into law, and this non decisive attitude to slavery continued as the nominated candidates for president of the two most popular parties were both indecisive on the issue of slavery.
                            Because of this, a new part was created. It was called the Free-Soil party (from its slogan "Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free men").
                            This party was completely opposed so slavery, and members of this party did not become president, but they did win some seats.
                            As you can see, sectionalism is very present in politics. 
                            The "United" States is acting more like two countries in an aliance.
                            Southern states have different ideals than northern states do, and this causes clashes.
                            Elections play a major role in this. 
                            Whenever a northern politician gets elected into government, this tips the legislative body as a whole closer to the northern ideals.
                            And the same goes for a southern politican.
                            Because the states are so polarized, the opinions of the legislative body are completely dependent on the balance between these states, and the electoral college enforces that.
                            This balance needs to be enforced because of the two party system, which means that two parties have to constantly fight and sometimes lock up because they cannot reach a consensus, and sometimes one of the parties has more representation in government than it does in public opinion.
                            Sectionalim was cemented into place into the political system with the Kansas-Nebraska act of 1854 which actually drew a line between the two sections of the country.
                            It further increased with the republican party being formed, and the Free-Soil party went into it, and it became a politically powerful anti-slavery party.
                            The republican candidate for president won majority in free states, but the democratic candidate got more votes overalll.
                            Later, earlier this year, in 1860, Abraham lincon won after barely loosing in the 1858 one.

                            The last few years Southern people have feared the Republican party, and this raid only heightened the fear.
                            On October 16, 1859 John Brown raided a federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia.
                            His goal? 
                            To arm african americans and lead a revolt to free them.
                            This raid was funded by abolitionists.
                            This was incredibly important because it shows that war is a possibility.
                            Violence has already happened, and its very possible that it will continue in to an all out war.
                            While John Brown was hanged for his crimes, it still sent a very powerful message, and southern people now knew that there was a northern conspiracy against them.

                            <h3>Did the South Have a Right to Secede?</h3>
                            <div></div>

                            After the 1860 election, the question of slavery was at a breaking point.
                            Although republicans promised not to ban slavery in places where it already exists, this was not enough for the south and they feared that the north would do it anyways.
                            On December 20, 1860, South Carolina seceded from the union.
                            Other southern states debated wether to follow suit or not.
                            Eventually no compromise could be reached, so the southern states seceded from the union earlier this month.
                            Were the southern states right in doing this?
                            From an ethical standpoint no because slavery is wrong and leaving the union and continueing to practice slavery is wrong, but from a political standpoint they should have waited to see if the north actually restricted slavery on existing slave states before they took any action.
